# Plot
In 1940s Shanghai, a powerful gang called the Crocodile gang terrorizes the police. However, the gang was easily and brutally defeated by a much more powerful gang known as the Axe Gang, led by a young killer named Brother Sum and an unnamed vice general. Only Shanghai's poorest villages and slums are not affected by the Axe gang's killings. One of those slums is Pigsty Alley. Two thieves named Sing and Bone visit the village to extort the residents by pretending to be Axe gang members, though Sing and Bone are revealed to be very weak and horrible at fighting. However, Sing's stupid actions eventually attract the attention of some real gang members and their vice general after he threw a firecracker that exploded onto the vice general's head. Just as the vice general was about to kill one of the residents, an unknown force blows him 50 feet back while also breaking his back, causing the full gang to arrive. However, they were all quickly dealt with by three of the slum's tenants: Coolie (who revealed himself to be the one who killed the vice general), Tailor, and Donut, who are actually kung fu masters. However, fearing the Axe Gang's retaliation, the slum's Landlady evicts the trio.
